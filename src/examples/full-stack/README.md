## Run the example

This example has a server that will reach out to the Duffel API to search and retrieve an offer.
To talk to the API we'll define the url to the API environment we want and .
Please add the following to `.env.local`:

This is a 'real life' example, where it uses a real offer ID and client key retrieved from the Duffel API. To run this, use `yarn run-example:full-stack`. This command will:

1. Serve the Duffel component bundle and watch for changes to rebuild on port `8000`. This can also be done with `yarn dev`
2. Run the full stack server using node. The example page will be ready on port `6262`. This can be done with `yarn run-full-stack-server`
