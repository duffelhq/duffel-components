# duffel-components react example

## TL;DR

Start on the root of the `duffel-components` repository:

```sh
# change directory to example folder
cd src/examples/react-app

# install new version
yarn

# build and watch example
yarn build

# open example
open src/index.html -a "Safari"
```

## Run example

Verify that the version of `@duffel/components` on package.json is the one that you want. Run `yarn` to install packages and `yarn dev` to build `src/examples/react-app/src/index.tsx`. This will produce `src/examples/react-app/dist` folder that is referenced by `src/examples/react-app/src/index.html`. You can then open `src/examples/react-app/src/index.html` on your browser to see the example up and running.
